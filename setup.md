> ## Data
{: .prereq}

For this lesson, we will use a number of different data sets. Download these files to your computer and put them in a location that you can find again later. 
(Some browsers may require you to right click on the link to specify the download location.)

- [sresa1b_ncar_ccsm3-example.nc](../data/sresa1b_ncar_ccsm3-example.nc)
- [CityCO2Emissions.csv](../data/CityCO2Emissions.csv)

Note: this data set is 1.6GB!

- [CMIP5_gridcar_CO2_emissions_fossil_fuel_Andres_1751-2007_monthly_SC_mask11.nc](http://eclipseice.ornl.gov/downloads/data_analysis/CMIP5_gridcar_CO2_emissions_fossil_fuel_Andres_1751-2007_monthly_SC_mask11.nc)

> ## Software
{: .prereq}
For this workshop we use Python version 3.x.

## Required Python Packages for this workshop

* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [netCDF4](http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

## Install the workshop packages

For installing these packages we will use Anaconda. 
Anaconda is a Python distribution aimed at data science.

### Anaconda installation

Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
Remember to download and install the installer for <b>Python 3.x</b> for your
platform.

You can download either the graphical or command-line installer. If you
download the command line installer, you will need to run the installer
using the `sh` command. For example, if you downloaded 
`Anaconda3-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`, you would need to run the command:

```
sh Anaconda3-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

It is usually necessary to restart your shell once you've installed Anaconda.

### Editing Python Scripts

In addition to the Python packages, you will also need access to a text editor
or a development environment for Python scripts. Nano is a good option for
anyone not used to text editing. See these 
[instructions](https://ornl-training.github.io/syllabus/setup/#a-text-editor) for how to install
Nano on Windows/Mac/Linux. If you have another editor you'd rather use
that is fine also.

Another alternative is to use a Python development environment such as
PyDev. Here are [instructions](https://ornl-training.github.io/syllabus/setup/#pydev) 
on how to install PyDev, but it's use is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

## Launch a Jupyter notebook

After installing either Anaconda or Miniconda and the workshop packages,
launch a Jupyter notebook by typing this command from the terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook should open automatically in your browser. If it does not or you
wish to use a different browser, open this link: <http://localhost:8888>.

## Overview of the Jupyter notebook (Optional)

### How the Jupyter notebook works

After typing the command `jupyter notebook`, the following happens:

* A Jupyter Notebook server is automatically created on your local machine.
* The Jupyter Notebook server runs locally on your machine only and does not
  use an internet connection.
* The Jupyter Notebook server opens the Jupyter notebook client, also known
  as the notebook user interface, in your default web browser.

  ![Jupyter notebook file browser](../fig/00_1_jupyter_file_browser.png)  
  *The Jupyter notebook file browser*

* To create a new Python notebook select the "New" dropdown on the upper
  right of the screen.

  ![Jupyter notebook file browser](../fig/00_2_jupyter_new_notebook.png)  
  *The Jupyter notebook file browser*

* When you can create a new notebook and type code into the browser, the web
  browser and the Jupyter notebook server communicate with each other.

* Under the "help" menu, take a quick interactive tour of how to
  use the notebook. Help on Jupyter and key workshop packages is
  available here too.

  ![Jupyter tour and help](../fig/00_4_jupyter_tour_help.png)  
  *User interface tour and Help*

* The Jupyter Notebook server does the work and calculations, and the web
  browser renders the notebook.
* The web browser then displays the updated notebook to you.

* For example, click in the first cell and type some Python code.

  ![Code cell](../fig/00_5_jupyter_code_before.png)  
  *A Code cell*

* This is a **Code** cell (see the cell type dropdown with the word **Code**).
  To run the cell, type Shift-Enter.

  ![Code cell and its output](../fig/00_6_jupyter_code_after.png)

* Let's look at a **Markdown** cell. Markdown is a text manipulation
  language that is readable yet offers additional formatting. Don't forget
  to select **Markdown** from the cell type dropdown. Click in the cell and
  enter the markdown text.

This workflow has several advantages:

- You can easily type, edit, and copy and paste blocks of code.
- Tab completion allows you to easily access the names of things you are using
  and learn more about them.
- It allows you to annotate your code with links, different sized text,
  bullets, etc. to make information more accessible to you and your
  collaborators.
- It allows you to display figures next to the code that produces them
  to tell a complete story of the analysis.

### How the notebook is stored

* The notebook file is stored in a format called JSON and has the suffix
  `.ipynb`.
* Just like HTML for a webpage, what's saved in a notebook file looks
  different from what you see in your browser.
* But this format allows Jupyter to mix software (in several languages) with
  documentation and graphics, all in one file.

### Notebook modes: Control and Edit

The notebook has two modes of operation: Control and Edit. Control mode lets
you edit notebook level features; while, Edit mode lets you change the
contents of a notebook cell. Remember a notebook is made up of a number of
cells which can contain code, markdown, html, visualizations, and more.

### Help and more information

Use the **Help** menu and its options when needed.
